            </h1>
            <p style="margin-top: 24px; color: var(--text-secondary);">Why you feel like a fraud, and the exact scripts
                to reframe your mindset.</p>
        </div>
    </header>

    <article class="blog-content">
        <p>In a survey of 10,000 software engineers by the blind app, <strong style="color: var(--primary);">58%
                reported experiencing imposter syndrome</strong>. Depending on who you ask at Google or Amazon, that
            number effectively rises to 80%.</p>

        <p>You know the feeling: You're in a code review, and a Senior Engineer points out a flaw in your logic. Your
            heart sinks. Your brain immediately whispers, <em>"This is it. They finally found out I don't know what I'm
                doing."</em></p>

        <p>This article isn't about "fake it 'til you make it." It's about linguistic re-framing: changing the words you
            use with yourself and others to build genuine confidence.</p>

        <h2>The "I Don't Know" Trap</h2>
        <p>Junior engineers fear saying "I don't know." Senior engineers revel in it. The difference is <em>how</em>
            they say it.</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4 style="color: var(--error); margin-bottom: 12px;">❌ The Junior Panic</h4>
            <p>"Uhh, I'm not sure... I think maybe it works like this?" (Voice trails off, sounds uncertain)</p>

            <h4 style="color: var(--success); margin-top: 24px; margin-bottom: 12px;">✅ The Senior Curiosity</h4>
            <p>"I haven't encountered that specific edge case before. Let me dig into the logs and I'll share what I
                find by 2 PM."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Notice the difference? The senior response transforms "ignorance" into an "investigation." It turns a lack of
            knowledge into a plan of action.</p>

        <h2>The Dunning-Kruger Effect</h2>
        <p>Psychologically, imposter syndrome often hits the hardest when you move from "Unconscious Incompetence"
            (Ignorance is bliss) to "Conscious Incompetence" (You know how much you don't know).</p>

        <div class="quote-box">
            "The more you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know. Feeling stupid is actually a sign of
            growth."
            <br><span style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: var(--text-secondary); margin-top: 12px; display: block;">— Dr.
                Carol Dweck, Stanford University</span>
        </div>

        <h2>3 Scripts to Reframe Your Mindset</h2>

        <h3>1. When You Make a Mistake</h3>
        <p>Avoid self-deprecation. Do not say "I'm so stupid."</p>
        <p><strong>Say instead:</strong> "Thanks for catching that. I see now that the race condition was caused by the
            async hook. I'll add a test case to prevent this in the future."</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> You shift focus from your <em>identity</em> ("I am stupid") to the
            <em>process</em> ("The hook caused the issue").</p>

        <h3>2. When You Feel Overwhelmed</h3>
        <p>Don't suffer in silence to prove you can do it alone.</p>
        <p><strong>Say instead:</strong> "I've been context-switching between three tickets and I want to ensure
            quality. Can you help me prioritize which of these is the critical path for launch?"</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> You frame the request as "strategic prioritization" rather than "inability to
            cope."</p>

        <h3>3. When You Receive Praise (And Don't Believe It)</h3>
        <p>Imposters often deflect praise ("Oh, it was nothing, just luck").</p>
        <p><strong>Say instead:</strong> "Thank you. It was a challenging migration, but I'm really proud of how the
            team handled the rollback strategy."</p>
        <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> You accept the credit while acknowledging the difficulty and sharing the win.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Imposter syndrome never fully goes away. Even Principal Engineers feel it when they switch domains. The goal
            isn't to kill the feeling. The goal is to stop it from silencing you in meetings.</p>
        <p>Speak up. Ask the "dumb" question. You'll be surprised how many others in the room were wondering the exact
            same thing.</p>
